    "text": "I am a young ambitious student who majored in Actuarial Science for my undergraduate studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) in Ghana and graduated with first-class honors in the department of Statistics and Actuarial science. While studying at KNUST, my first research experience was with three other colleagues to research on a project entitled ???Estimating the surrender rate of life insurance policies??? which had the objective of determining the surrendering rate of insurance contracts using the cox regression and survival analysis methods like the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators. The project exposed me to the fundamentals of research work and gave me the experience to prepare for advanced-level research. In line with leadership roles, I was the Chief Editor for the Actuarial Science Student Association of Ghana and was also selected to represent my school at an Annual Lady Chief Justice mentoring program held at the supreme court of Ghana. I also worked on brand advertisements by designing flyers and posters for campus events, managed social media handles for a charity group named the Christy Hope Foundation, and organized various tutorial classes for first-year statistics and mathematics students which had a great impact on their academic performance.\nMy first professional experience was an internship at Old Mutual Life Assurance Company during the summer of 2018 under the distribution support department. My duties included processing claims, processing policy amendments, and capturing new businesses. I also worked with Old Mutual Life Assurance again as a Graduate Trainee in 2020 now in charge of processing commissions for financial advisors and preparing new business reports for the company. I used software programs like Microsoft Excel and R Studio for my reports, which improved my understanding and ability to apply statistics to solve real-life problems and gave me deeper insights into how statistics and data analysis are fundamental to growth in any sector.\nI completed my Masters degree in Statistics at Montana State University, Bozeman, USA. And earned an excellent pass for all the fundamental core courses (Intermediate Mathematics and Statistics, Advanced regression analysis, Linear Models, and Intermediate probability and statistics and participated in statistical consulting sections aimed at helping other graduate students and organizations with solutions on the right statistical approach for their projects and research. One project we worked on was aimed at analyzing data from survey responses for a Kinship Navigator program meant to provide support for non-parent family members raising relative children. Also, under the supervision of Dr. Ian Laga, I successfully completed a Masters thesis that focused on Bayesian Computational Methods For Latent Space Models in Networks. For the study, we examined latent space model, the type of statistical network model with the common practice of using both observed and unobserved (i.e., latent) variables in modeling an outcome in the presence or absence of network edges. The problem with estimating the parameters of the latent space model is that it can be computationally expensive when dealing with large network data. The aim was to discuss some of the existing methods for estimating the parameters of the latent space model and then use the Laplace approximation technique to estimate the parameters of this model. We then compared the Laplace approximation to the latentnet package and assessed how well they estimate the latent distances and the computational cost involved using a simulation study and then applied this new approach to a real data to see how it performs. I also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Montana State University with one year of teaching experience serving as an instructor for the Introduction to Statistics course and College Algebra. I balanced my coursework and teaching duties by taking an active part in extra-curricular activities such as participating in volunteer programs and playing a key role in the African student society at Montana State University.\nCurrently, I am a Ph.D. Statistics student at Virginia Tech and a Graduate Teaching Assistance for Statistics for social science here at the University. It is my dream to work as a Statistician and a Data Analyst and start my own statistical consulting firm. I would also love to return to my homeland some day to impact the lives of the young ones and make significant contributions to better the numerous statistical problems facing my country, Ghana."

    "text": "Networks are collections of interconnected things or collections of elements and their inter-relations. A network consists of the links between members of a set of actors or nodes connected by a specific kind of relationship. Networks have now been useful in studying complex systems across a diverse range of application areas. In biology, it has been useful for the study of protein-protein interactions (Pellegrini, Haynor, and Johnson (2004)). In engineering, it can be applied in electrical engineering and electronics to understand the components of electrical circuits (Kumar (2008)) and in transportation for modeling and analyzing transport networks (Tarapata (2015)). In finance, it can be used as a tool to study the relationships between market participants and their impacts on the financial market (Liang and Guo (2015)). It can be applied in Neuroscience to explore the patterns of voltage dynamics in the brain associated with epileptic seizures (Kramer and Cash (2012)) and also in the field of education to understand the patterns related to the citation of articles or journals (Newman (2004)), legal cases (Olsen and Küçüksu (2017)), and many others.\nA network structure is made up of nodes (vertices) and edges (links). Nodes represent the objects or subjects being studied, while edges represent the relationships between those objects. For example, if we investigate a social relationship between Facebook users, nodes represent users and edges represent relationships such as user friendships or group memberships. From Kolaczyk and Csárdi (2014), the mathematical structure of a network graph is defined as \\(G = (V, E)\\) which is composed of a set \\(V\\) of vertices and a set \\(E\\) of edges, with elements of \\(E\\) being unordered pairs \\({u, v}\\) of distinct vertices \\(u, v \\in V\\). The order of the graph \\(G\\) is sometimes referred to as the number of vertices \\(N_v = |V|\\) and the size as the number of edges \\(N_e = |E|\\).\nUnderstanding the structure of a network and how it came to be is very essential to network analysis. That is, we can imagine the network as the result of some underlying processes associated with the complex system of interest to us, and then ask what the most important aspects of these processes are. So we may want to know more about the actual manner in which the network was obtained, i.e., the corresponding measurement and construction process of the network. Such concerns provide an impetus for network modeling and related statistical inference tools. Some examples of statistical network models include the exponential random graph models, which are analogous to generalized linear models, stochastic block models, which are a type of mixture model, and the latent space model which can be used for a variety of purposes, for example, clustering of network data into groups with more similar characteristics (Zhou et al. (2019)).\nFor the study, we examined latent space model, the type of statistical network model with the common practice of using both observed and unobserved (i.e., latent) variables in modeling an outcome in the presence or absence of network edges. The problem with estimating the parameters of the latent space model is that it can be computationally expensive when dealing with large network data. We have a computational cost of order \\(O\\left(N^2\\right)\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of nodes or actors in the network which means that the time required to perform a particular computation increases quadratically with the size of the nodes of the network, so when we have a large network data, working with the latent space model becomes infeasible. The aim was to discuss some of the existing methods for estimating the parameters of the latent space model and then use the Laplace approximation technique to estimate the parameters of this model. We then compared the Laplace approximation to the latentnet package and assessed how well they estimate the latent distances and the computational cost involved using a simulation study and then applied this new approach to a real-data to see how it performs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKolaczyk, Eric D, and Gábor Csárdi. 2014.

Beyond that, I’ve explored some incredible hiking spots in Bozeman, Montana, which have added a touch of adventure to my life.\n\nThis photo was snapped during my visit to Yellowstone National Park in Montana in 2023. The scene is absolutely breathtaking. I experienced the park’s remarkable natural beauty with its colorful geysers and lush green surroundings. It’s a place where nature’s power and beauty come together in harmony. Yellowstone left a lasting impression on me, and I’m grateful for the chance to witness such a stunning landscape.yes"
