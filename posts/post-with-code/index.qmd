Networks are collections of interconnected things or collections of elements and their inter-relations. A network consists of the links between members of a set of actors or nodes connected by a specific kind of relationship. Networks have now been useful in studying complex systems across a diverse range of application areas. In biology, it has been useful for the study of protein-protein interactions (@pellegrini2004protein). In engineering, it can be applied in electrical engineering and electronics to understand the components of electrical circuits (@kumar2008electric) and in transportation for modeling and analyzing transport networks (@tarapata2015modelling). In finance, it can be used as a tool to study the relationships between market participants and their impacts on the financial market (@liang2015social). It can be applied in Neuroscience to explore the patterns of voltage dynamics in the brain associated with epileptic seizures (@kramer2012epilepsy) and also in the field of education to understand the patterns related to the citation of articles or journals (@newman2004coauthorship), legal cases (@olsen2017finding), and many others.

A network structure is made up of nodes (vertices) and edges (links). Nodes represent the objects or subjects being studied, while edges represent the relationships between those objects. For example, if we investigate a social relationship between Facebook users, nodes represent users and edges represent relationships such as user friendships or group memberships. From @kolaczyk2014statistical, the mathematical structure of a network graph is defined as $G = (V, E)$ which is composed of a set $V$ of vertices and a set $E$ of edges, with elements of $E$ being unordered pairs ${u, v}$ of distinct vertices $u, v \in V$. The order of the graph $G$ is sometimes referred to as the number of vertices $N_v = |V|$ and the size as the number of edges $N_e = |E|$.

Understanding the structure of a network and how it came to be is very essential to network analysis. That is, we can imagine the network as the result of some underlying processes associated with the complex system of interest to us, and then ask what the most important aspects of these processes are. So we may want to know more about the actual manner in which the network was obtained, i.e., the corresponding measurement and construction process of the network. Such concerns provide an impetus for network modeling and related statistical inference tools. Some examples of statistical network models include the exponential random graph models, which are analogous to generalized linear models, stochastic block models, which are a type of mixture model, and the latent space model which can be used for a variety of purposes, for example, clustering of network data into groups with more similar characteristics (@zhou2019latent). 

For the study, we examined latent space model, the type of statistical network model with the common practice of using both observed and unobserved (i.e., latent) variables in modeling an outcome in the presence or absence of network edges. The problem with estimating the parameters of the latent space model is that it can be computationally expensive when dealing with large network data. We have a computational cost of order $O\left(N^2\right)$ where $N$ is the number of nodes or actors in the network which means that the time required to perform a particular computation increases quadratically with the size of the nodes of the network, so when we have a large network data, working with the latent space model becomes infeasible. The aim was to discuss some of the existing methods for estimating the parameters of the latent space model and then use the Laplace approximation technique to estimate the parameters of this model. We then compared the Laplace approximation to the latentnet package and assessed how well they estimate the latent distances and the computational cost involved using a simulation study and then applied this new approach to a real-data to see how it performs.
